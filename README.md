# PlantBiophysics paper

This is the repository for the Pluto notebooks related to the scientific paper about [PlantBiophysics.jl](https://github.com/VEZY/PlantBiophysics.jl).
This repository automatically makes a website from these notebooks using Github actions and [JuliaTutorialsTemplate](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/JuliaTutorialsTemplate).
The website is available here: https://vezy.github.io/PlantBiophysics-paper/

## To do list:
- [x] Figure global data with PB.jl only
- [x] Figure global data with all packages
- [x] Day figure with PB.jl scalar
- [x] Day figure with PB.jl uncertainty propagation
- [x] Performance figure
- [x] Make Pluto notebook for global data
- [x] Adapt Pluto notebook for day evaluation with Makie
- [ ] Update with PlantBiophysics.jl 0.8.0 (especially daily_evaluation Pluto notebook)
